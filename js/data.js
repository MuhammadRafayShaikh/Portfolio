Employees and customers can book tickets after logging in, while admins manage buses, pricing, and staff. The system automates fare calculations, age-based discounts, and refunds based on bus type and distance.
  
          Implementation:
Database: To store bus details, employee records, booking history, and fare rules.
Authentication: A secure login system that allows access only to authorized users.
Admin Panel: Where bus data, fares, and employee details can be managed.
Booking System: To automate ticket generation and fare calculation.`,

          I developed a ticket booking system with dynamic pricing, which automatically calculates fares based on bus type, distance, and customer age. Additionally, I implemented seat availability tracking and a refund system that applies cancellation rules to process reimbursements accordingly.
          
          This project also helped me understand CRUD operations, search and filtering, and how to create an efficient UI for booking management. Working with ASP.NET Core MVC, I improved my skills in handling form submissions, validations, and generating unique codes for employees and buses.`,
